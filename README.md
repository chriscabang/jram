**Time tracking software is a tool used by managers and employees to record worked hours for billing, payroll or operations. In general, they capture time spent on assigned tasks and used to automate payroll or client invoicing. They can also provide insights on your operations, such as, which tasks are taking a lot of your staffâ€™s time and costing the most money, allowing users to plan project budgets.**
